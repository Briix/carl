# Carl
Carl, because Mark would be too obvious.

Carl is meant as a zero configuration Markdown to PDF converter. Uses
[Nightmare](https://github.com/segmentio/nightmare) under the hood to convert
the Markdown document to HTML before converting to PDF.

## Installation
```bash
npm install -g carl-md
```

## Usage
```bash
Carl - Convert Markdown to PDF

Usage: carl [options] <markdown-file-path>

Options:
  -h      Output usage information
  -o      Specify output file
  -g      Render Markdown using Github flavoured CSS
  -s      Path to custom CSS
  -d      Enable debug information

Bugs: https://github.com/Briix/carl/issues
```

Although Carl does provide some basic options, it works out of the box without
using any of the options.
